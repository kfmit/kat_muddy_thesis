	This thesis was produced thanks to generous help and support from an abundance of sources, from MIT, WHOI, and outside the institutions. A special thanks to my advisor, Dr. Julien Bonnel for unexpectedly taking me on as his first Navy student when circumstances arose, giving me an interesting project, and reading all of my confusing words. For all those who made CANAPE possible, I hope that my work helps to further the purposes of the project. I also appreciate the support of so many fellow students and family members who helped me get through the difficult first years of MIT-online due to COVID-19. A shoutout to Dr. Mike Benjamin for making the most interesting and entertaining class I've ever taken through a laptop, and for approving all my courses. And thank you to Dr. Erin Fischell for welcoming me into the Joint Program in such un-normal times. \\
